            <p>Where must I look<br />Why did I turn my back <br />I look around and I see unfamiliar faces<br />Yet the face that makes me happy<br />Is the face that I put the blame<br />Which path leads me to a better place<br />A place where shame cannot shelter<br />Where is the guiding beam of light<br />That grants illumination of the mind<br />I am to bear this burden<br />Yet the fault is not mine nor his<br />But ours which we failed to nurse</p>
            
            <p>Peace was ours yet we chose war<br />Moments of purity was within grasp<br />Like a petal it was plucked from our souls<br />We created our destiny and destiny tore us apart<br />We were good as two<br />But as one we failed<br />The bigger picture still lingers in my mind<br />Yet the small became the priority<br />Should forgiveness be asked over and over<br />Should there be another chance given<br />Will these wounds heal in time<br />Before love itself expires?</p>

            <p>I long to be nineteen again when all<br />I wanted was to chase away my virtues<br />At the prime of life when childhood fancies<br />Gave way to adult proclamations<br />It was a time when beauty was skin-deep<br />And the pace at which I gambled with life<br />Never seem to take its toll<br />Self-indulgence surrendered to no one<br />And I chose to asphyxiate self-control<br />Time came and went<br />With every action unaccounted for<br />I had no shame but lessons were learnt<br />And the campaign for truth was linear<br />Now all that seems true seems careless.</p>

            <p>The thought of him cramps my stomach<br />It is a pain that bears the mark of a martyr<br />Yet I have been less than self-sacrificing<br />When all I did was point the finger</p>
            
            <p>This is it for us as a singular<br />We as plural live lives apart<br />Him in the country and I in the city<br />Both forgetting where to start</p>

            <p>The tune of a fading voice remains<br />Terre de Hermes lingers in my bed<br />I change the sheets but to no avail<br />The scent has settled in my head</p>
            
            <p>Drifting between sunlight and shadow<br />His memory keeps my bed warm<br />Days are too long while nights give way<br />To a sky where thunder clouds form.</p>

            <p>I am most ugly <br />When dull thoughts fill my mind<br />In the dead of night<br />The mind stirs with one eye blind<br />I talk to no one<br />But everyone hears my cry<br />Nowhere to turn<br />I set myself up for the fall<br />Emotions wane as <br />And I confuse shock with euphoria <br />I pray in his name<br />For the sweet thrill of surrender<br />My voice dissolves<br />As I try to make things clearer<br />Grant me one wish<br />So we could all sleep easier.</p>

            <p>If and when we meet again<br />Will it be anti-climatic<br />Will we be familiar strangers<br />And laugh at being over-dramatic</p>

            <p>So let us meet each other again<br />For our lives are fused as one<br />Even as friends I would not mind<br />Just say the word and I will come.</p>
